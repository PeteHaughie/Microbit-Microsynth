# Micro:bit-Microsynth

## What is it?

The Micro:bit Microsynth was born from a need to make something that beeped for a recording. It's a pretty harsh square wave and I only coded in a few notes but I think the examples are enough to work from if you needed to extend it.

## How do I use it?

Connect a crocodile clip to each of the 0 pin and GND contacts of a powered Micro:bit running the Microsynth sketch to the GND (end) and left and or right or mono segments of a headphone jack and have fun. You can move the 'cursor' by moving it left, right, up, and down. Press the A button to leave a note. You can cycle through the available notes by staying on the same spot and pressing A. Press button B on a position to remove a note. 

The synth itself is very simple. It has 4 bars of 4 beats and you can see the playhead move from left to right, top to bottom.
