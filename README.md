# Micro:bit-Microsynth

## What is it?

The Micro:bit Microsynth was born from a need to make something that beeped foro a redording. It's a pretty harsh square wave and I only coded in a few notes but I think the examples are enough to work from if you needed to extend it.

## How do I use it?

Connect a crocodile clip to each of the 3V and GND contacts of the Micro:bit. You can move the 'cursor' by moving it left, right, up, and down. Press the A button to leave a note. You can cycle through the available notes by staying on the same spot and pressing A. Press button B on a position to remove a note.
